1. Let `$X$` be a topological space and `$|X|$` be the set of path-connected components of `$X$`.

    * __(a).__ Show that `$H_0(X)$` is isomorphic to  the free abelian group generated by `$|X|$`.
    * __(b).__  For `$n\geq 0$`, show that `$H_n(X) \cong \oplus_{j\in |X|} H_n(X_j)$`, where `$\{X_j\}_{j \in |X|}$` are the connected components of `$X$`. 

2. Recall that the augmented chain complex for a topological space `$X$` has `$C_{-1}(X) = \mathbb{Z}$` and `$\partial_{-1} = 0$`. 

    * __(a).__ Show that if `$X\neq\phi$`, there is a short exact sequence `$0 \to \widetilde{H_0}(X) \to H_0(X) \to   \mathbb{Z}$` .
    * __(b).__ Show that (if `$X\neq\phi$`) the above short exact sequence splits, and hence we have `$H_0(X) = \widetilde{H_0}(X)\oplus \mathbb{Z}$`.
    * __(c).__ What happens to tbe above two statements if `$X = \phi$`.
    * __(d).__ What is `$H_{-1}(X)$`? Consider both the cases when `$X$` is empty and non-empty.

3. Let `$X$` be a topological space, `$A\neq \phi$` a closed subset and `$U\supset A$` be an open set that deformation retracts to `$A$`. Let `$X/A$` denote the quotient space where all points of `$A$` are identified.

    * __(a).__ Show that, for `$n\geq 0$`, `$H_n(X, A) \cong H_n(X, U) \cong H_n(X/ A, U /A)$`.
    * __(b).__ Conclude that `$H_n(X, A) \cong \widetilde{H_n}(X/A)$` for all `$n\geq 0$`.
